## Introduction ##
All tasks descriptions will be in this README.md file of the corresponding branch. The workflow should be:

Create a fork of this repository at bitbucket + give the bitbucket user megusta-infrastructure access to your repo.

1. You decide which task you like to start.
2. Start working only on that task. Don't log more that the max hour specified. If you are experienced in some area, some task might go a lot faster. 
3. Push you final solution / answer to the corresponding feature branch. Written answers can be inserted inside the README.md directly behind the questions.
